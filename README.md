# Project Application - Dinner's Ready

This project brings me back to my childhood, especially around the holidays.
It was too common when my mom, or one of my aunts, calls out to my siblings, cousins, and I dinner was ready! Circling back
to a modern 2020 each person in our family has a cell phone, and regularlly uses it. So, that lead me to creating a modern solution
for a "dated" problem. Utilizing Dinner's ready you simply use the web for and enter the recipients phone number, your name, 
recipient's name, and your message to them. Click send, and they'll get a text message!

## Project Scope

I initally started this project to understand how to interact with APIs. The beginning stages of my testing was to utilize
Postman, and interact with the Twilio API sending myself test text-messages. Which soon laid the ground work for scaling this
project up into a full-stack application. I then utilized various helper libraries and SDK's to understand how the Javascript 
frameworks will interact with the API leading me down the path of the web application.

A big thank you to Craig Dennis and freecodecamp.org for creating excellent instructional content.
I utilized Craig's lessons for his application Complimentr, and based Dinner's Ready on his lessons.
